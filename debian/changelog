gimp1.2 (1.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Do not include escputil or man pages in gimp1.2 (there is already
    a separate package for that).  No dependancy is needed, since
    the GIMP print plugin does not call escputil directly.
    (Closes: #142013, #141892)
  * Patch url.c (which is a MONSTROUS hack) to deal with the fact that
    wget now outputs a "Resolving host.name.com.... done" line.  This
    throws off the hard-coded parsing function in url.c, and makes it
    impossible to open URL files. (Really fixes #137132).
    Patch is at http://people.debian.org/~che/gimp/url.patch

gimp1.2 (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: #140904)
  * Remove TIFF from description of gimp1.2-nonfree. (Closes: #88381)
  * Fixed config.guess upstream (and in NMU).  (Closes: #120875)
  * Change -I/usr/include/gnome-1.0 to be set in environment CFLAGS,
    so I don't have to patch configure.in every time.
  * Upstream now includes symlinks for names gimp -> gimp-1.2, for
    all binaries and man pages, so we do too.
  * gimp1.2 now depends on wget | wget-ssl; cannot open URLs otherwise.
    (Closes: #137132)
  * Include escputil print plug-in utility for cleaning nozzle heads,
    etc. on Epson printers.

gimp1.2 (1.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Based on Colin's patch.
  * Make /etc/gimp/1.2/* conffiles (closes: #132167).
  * Adjust libpng2-dev build-dependency so that it definitely won't match
    png3 (not sure if that would affect plugins).
  * Does *not* add libgnome-dev to build-dependencies as Colin's patch
    does.  We need libgtkxmhtml*-dev, *not* libgnome-dev.  I will not
    ever require the massive GNOME libraries to build or run GIMP,
    unless it becomes a GNOME project.  The help browser should build
    fine as long as libgtkxmhtml-dev is installed.
  * Found the above problem -- libgtkxmhtml-dev renamed its include files
    without warning to /usr/include/gnome-1.0/gtk-xmhtml/ for absolutely
    no reason at all which broke GIMP's compilation process.
    Patched configure.in and to always add -I/usr/include/gnome-1.0
    as a quick solution.

gimp1.2 (1.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Sven, who released GIMP 1.2.2, messed up and incremented the soname
    of the library.  This was completely gratuitous and unnecessary for a
    STABLE release, and broke tons of things (libgimp1.2 dependancies,
    SANE, etc.)  So I edited configure.in to change the GIMP_INTERFACE_AGE
    and GIMP_BINARY_AGE to 2 so bring the soname back down to the same as
    1.2.1. (Closes: #103238)

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Aug 2001 12:44:37 +0900

  * Add to the front of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, don't clobber it, when
    we need to do a dpkg-shlibdeps for gimp1.2-nonfree. (Closes: #104462)
  * Add Enhances: tages for gimp1.2-perl and gimp1.2-nonfree -> gimp1.2.

gimp1.2 (1.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change Build-Depends from xpm4g-dev to xlibs-dev. (Closes: #90801)
  * Remove Build-Depends on xlib6g-dev (it's covered by xlibs-dev now.)
  * Add Build-Depends on libtiff3g-dev and gettext. (oops!)
  * Fix typo in debian/rules so man page for gimp-remote gets included.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Mar 2001 01:50:58 -0800

gimp1.2 (1.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include gimp-remote and gimp-remote.1 man page in gimp1.2 package.
    (Closes: #89996) (Why didn't *I* get bug #90000? :)
  * Recompile so gimptool has the right include paths for glib 1.2.9
    and gtk+ 1.2.9.  (Closes: #90600, #89001)
  * It's weird, but the old building hack I had to set PERL_MM_OPTS
    was working. Evidently not for everyone. Removed quotes.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Mar 2001 11:54:51 -0800

gimp1.2 (1.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Darn it. The GIMP folks keep the soname of libgimp et al the
    same for the stable releases, but my soname guessing code from
    the 1.1 series thought that it'd follow the minor revision (the last
    1 in 1.2.1) as it did in the 1.1 series.  But in the 1.2 series, the
    soname will always (Manish promises) be 0, so we don't need to
    auto-generate debian/shlibs.local for proper dependancies. This
    makes gimp1.2 depend on libgimp1.2 properly again. (Closes: #88098)
  * This was already fixed (gimp 1.2 does not look for plugins in
    /usr/lib/gimp/1.1/, honestly). (Closes: #80840)
  * Add Replaces: gimp1.1-nonfree (<< 1.1.27-1) to gimp1.2 to make for
    proper upgrades (the tiff plugin moved at that time from nonfree to
    the main package.)  (Closes: #83726)

  * Updated to use new Perl building policy; we're using dh_perl for
    some of this, so add Build-Depends on perl (>= 5.6.0-16) and 
    debhelper (>= 3.0.5).
  * Update Build-Depends to specify libglib1.2/libgtk1.2 >= 1.2.8. 
    (Closes: #87046)
  * In README.Debian, mention that gimptool is in libgimp1.2-dev.

  * GIMP saves gif just fine. (Closes: #82369)
  * Evidently large numbers of open files bug fixed upstream.

  * Fixed improper use of "it's" in app/user_install.c. Forwarded
    patch  upstream. Closes: #71521
  * Fixed upstream: installation crash (Closes: #71519)
  * Looked at a lot of the nice changes in the helix gimp1.1 packages
    and applied 'em.
  * IMPORTANT MOVE: I realized that the libgimp1.1.27-style packages
    had to die a flaming horrible death. Moved to libgimp1.1 and
    libgimp1.1-dev package naming style. This has the consequence
    that I've had to make the shlibs file make things compiled against
    libgimp1.1 depend on libgimp1.1 (>= 1.1.27.0), libgimp1.1 (<< 1.1.28).
  * Because of the above, to clean out everyone's systems, I've made
    libgimp1.1 Conflict: with all the old libgimp1.1.xs, and libgimp1.1-dev
    Conflict: with all old libgimp1.1.x-devs. Closes: #62532

  * script-fu breakage due to not having fonts installed documented
    in README.Debian and dependancies. Closes: #48840, #49003

  * Old libgimp1.1.x lying around problem cured with new naming
    scheme. Closes: #62532

    Closes: #65378

  * The BMP mentioned in bug #67415 does not crash GIMP. Closes: #67415
  * Faulty order in package build (built gimp1.1 before gimp1.1-perl)
    led some Perl plugins to be included in the gimp1.1 package.

    lprng for me. Closes: #72448
  * gimp-python is maintained separately. Closes: #58548 
  * Moved gimp binary to /usr/bin. This is to follow policy, and
    also fixes a problem with the GIMP Perl module. Closes: #66469

    (Yes, this must make it into frozen, otherwise gimp1.1 doesn't
     work.)
  * As a consequence of the above, gimp1.1-perl Replaces: gimp1.1 
    (<< 1.1.15-3).
  * Make sure libgimp1.1.15 doesn't include any Perl directories.

gimp1.1 (1.1.15-2) frozen unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Argh. I had messed up the build process and no files actually
    got into gimp1.1-perl. This rebuild must make it into frozen,
  * Make gimp1.1-perl Depend: on gimp1.1 (>= ${Source-Version}) so
    people don't try to install it with a mismatching gimp package.
  * Add Suggests: from gimp1.1 to gimp1.1-perl.
  * To make slink -> potato upgrade easier (read: possible), sprinkle 
    Replaces: liberally around.

gimp1.1 (1.1.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add dependancies on libgtk-perl and pdl. Closes: #53971, #53826
  * Build with perl Image::Magick support. Add dependancy on perlmagick.
  * If anyone thinks any of the above new dependancies (libgtk-perl, pdl,
    perlmagick) should be made into Suggests, let me know. I couldn't
    decide, so went with a Depends to be on the safe side. But, this
    requires about 6 more megs of packages to be installed, so some
    people may not be happy.
  * Patch the stupid Makefile.PL in plug-ins/perl/Makefile.PL to not
    force UNINST=1 on the 'make install'. GRRR!

  * Now includes gimp-perl and the related Perl plugins in the main 
    gimp package. Closes: #34392
  * Still no gimp help browser, as libgtkxmhtml-dev depends on a whole
    slew of GNOME libraries which I am not willing to foist on
    unsuspecting GIMP users.
  * Fixed in earlier releases: Closes: #42096, #42699

  * New upstream version.
  * Change auto-generation of shlibs file to make things compiled against
    libgimp to depend on (e.g.) >= 1.1.8 instead of >= 1.1.8-1. This
    makes building slink packages with versions like 1.1.8-0slink1
    work.

gimp1.1 (1.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Change Recommends: of xfnts-100dpi to a Suggests, as it seems GIMP will
    work without it nowadays.
  * Upstream has restructured /usr/share/gimp and I missed it; that's
    why the help files and tips of the day were missing. 
    (Fixes: #42699, #42096)
  * libgimp1.1.8-dev Depends: on Source-Version of libgimp1.1.8 now.

gimp1.1 (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Perl extension won't work until the Debian libgtk-perl package

    libgtk-perl is recompiled against GTK+ 1.2 and updated from the

gimp (1.0.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * The gimp package no longer depends explicitly on xfnt{75,100}. I
    downgraded the relationship to a Recommends: and added big fat
    warnings in the README and in the package description.
    Fixes bugs #14600 and #21055. This has been changed because it's
    possible to run GIMP using a remote font server to serve the 75/100dpi
    fonts. However, it's really no big deal to ask for them to be installed
    locally, so the relationship should be Recommends:.
  * The above Recommends: has been changed to xfonts-{75,100}dpi, although
    it's pretty silly that their names were changed without adding a
    Provides:. *grumble*
  * Bumped the version number in the dependancy of gimp on gimp-data-extras
    to (>= 1:1.0.0).
  * libgimp-dev now conflicts with libglib-dev, so people don't try
    compiling plugins when they only have GTK+ 1.1 installed.
